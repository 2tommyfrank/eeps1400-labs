# EEPS 1400: Climate Modeling I - Labs

## Instructions

In each section, read each text or code cell and then run it with Shift + Enter. If you're a quantitative student, you don't have to complete any of the sections marked (Qual). If you're a qualitative student, you don't have to complete any of the sections marked (Quant). Whenever you see *TO-DO* in a code block, that indicates a coding task to complete before you run that cell. You can always re-run a cell after you make changes to it.

When you close the Jupter application and come back to it later, you need to re-run all the cells in the part you're working on. But if you're working on Part 2, for example, you don't need to run all the Part 1 cells again.
